# Full Stack Open 2024

This repository contains my exercise solutions for the [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/) course by the University of Helsinki.

## About the Course

Full Stack Open is a comprehensive introduction to modern web development with JavaScript. The course covers:

- React
- Redux
- Node.js
- MongoDB
- GraphQL
- TypeScript

The main focus is on building single-page applications with ReactJS that use REST APIs built with Node.js.

## Course Progress

### Part 0: Fundamentals of Web apps ✅
- [x] 0.1–0.3: Basic HTML, CSS, forms
- [x] 0.4–0.6: Request/response and SPA behavior via sequence diagrams

### Part 1: Introduction to React ✅
- [x] a) Introduction to React  
  - Vite-based React setup
  - Function components and JSX
  - Composition and props
  - JSX rules (single root, capitalization, etc.)

- [x] b) JavaScript  
  - Modern JS syntax: `const`/`let`, arrow functions
  - Arrays and objects (map/filter, destructuring)
  - Basic classes and `this`
  - Course info exercises using arrays/objects

- [x] c) Component state, event handlers  
  - `useState` and basic stateful components
  - Event handlers (`onClick`) and handler functions
  - Lifting state and passing handlers to children
  - Refactoring into smaller components

- [x] d) A more complex state, debugging React apps  
  - Managing state with multiple `useState`, objects, and arrays
  - Immutable updates (spread, `concat`, `map`)
  - Async state updates and derived values
  - Conditional rendering (`History`, empty vs non-empty UI)
  - Debugging with console, DevTools, React DevTools
  - Hook rules and event handler patterns
  - Exercises: `unicafe` and `anecdotes` apps

### Part 2: Communicating with server
- [x] 2a) Rendering a collection, modules  
  - Rendering collections with `Array.map` and keys
  - Avoiding index-based keys
  - Extracting list items into components (e.g. `Note`)
  - Splitting components into modules
  - Course info extended with `reduce` and multiple courses

- [x] 2b) Forms  
  - Form state with `useState`
  - Controlled inputs (`value` + `onChange`)
  - Handling submit with `onSubmit` / `preventDefault`
  - Immutable list updates and simple filtering
  - Phonebook: add names, prevent duplicates, add numbers, filter, component extraction

- [x] 2c) Getting data from server  
  - JSON Server as a mock backend
  - Adding dependencies with npm (`axios`, `json-server`)
  - Basic Axios usage and promises
  - Data loading in `useEffect` with dependency arrays
  - Phonebook: initial data from backend

- [x] 2d) Altering data in server  
  - REST-style operations: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`
  - Creating and updating resources with Axios
  - Updating local state immutably after server changes
  - Extracting HTTP logic into a `services` module
  - Promise chaining and error handling (`.catch`)
  - Phonebook: create, update, delete, and sync with backend

- [x] 2e) Adding styles to React app  
  - Global CSS via imported stylesheet
  - Class-based styling with `className`
  - Notification component with conditional render + timeout
  - Inline styles with JS style objects
  - Phonebook + Notes: basic styling and user-facing notifications
  - Countries app: RESTCountries + weather API (with env-based API key)
